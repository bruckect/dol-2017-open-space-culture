# DevOps Library Nano Conference 2017
# Building a DevOps Culture Open Space

## Takeaways
+ As individual contributors, we can either attempt to change our current company or change companies.
+ We need to realize that we cannot apply technology to a people problem. "Can't buy the DevOps"
+ Measure things, not everything, but figure out what is important to you, your boss, your company.
+ True change comes from the top down. Management must empower employees and build trust through collaboration.
+ Infrastructure as Code is a start, need to be working toward becoming a full out developer
+ The toolchain is never complete, the problem will always change, if people become bored, they've stopped learning.

### How can we attempt to make a change?
+ Work within our spheres of influence
+ Try to slowly build adoption within the teams.
    + Small gains compound and build up over time. 20-30% adoption is a good thing!
+ Realize that few will adopt, most will resist, since we are changing the status quo and people are comfortable
    + Some may feel that we want replace them, don't want to change their skills, etc
    + Fear paralyzes people, encourage them that they can change, help them to a certain point, management may ultimately decide to get rid of them
+ Stay positive, be patient, apply slow, gentle pressure to change
    + Do retrospectives after major incidents
    + Have the team demo what new things they are building/learning each week
    + Take turns working tickets throughout the day/week
    + Continue to build on the confidence that your manager has in you (make them look good, consistently)
    
### Individual Contributor to Leader
+ Nurture your relationships that you have built as an IC. This is often times harder than being in a technical role
+ Speak in terms that executives can understand. Demonstrate that what you are doing to shaving down operational costs which in turn saves the company money.
+ Make your work tangible to the lines of business and upper management.

### [TicketMaster's Tech Maturity Model](https://tech.ticketmaster.com/tag/tech-maturity/)
+ 60-70 questions which assess the technical architecture of their products
+ Used to assess the maturity of the product and their team
+ Provides an easy way to baseline improvements
+ Sets the minimum standards for migrating applications to the cloud
+ Focus on a small aspect of things and iteratively improve over time

### Never the end - This is not an overnight change
+ Group consensus is that noticeable change to CI/CD workflow can take 3-4 years to become commonplace.
+ Recruitment
    + Hire PowerShell Developers
        + People that can write and create new PowerShell Advanced Functions and Modules, not just consumers of what others do
    + Ask theoretical questions to see how the candidate will approach a problem and solve it
        + Do they actually solve the problem?
        + Do they ask clarifying questions?
        + Do they think outside the box?
    + Hire people that are perpetual students, people that want to learn!
    + Check their resume for Github/blog URL or ask them if they have either
        + This implies that they are a good communicator, student and educator
+ Measure things!!! 
    + You need to know how much time you are spending maintaining current products vs building new products
+ Management doesn't always keep up with today's technology, that's what they pay us for!
    + Determine if your management does want to trust their employees and build upon that. If not, probably time to leave
+ Realize that certain industries may not adopt quickly and may not adopt DevOps for quite a while:
    + Government
    + Banking/Traditional Finance
    + Healthcare
    + Industrial Engineering/Assembly lines
